# Project 1: Billboard Search App

## Description

The Billboard Search App enables users to search for the top songs by country. First the user will enter in what country's top songs they want. It will then show them the top 20 songs of the searched country. The user can then click on the picture/name of the song and a video of the song will be played for them.
